# POSIX Shell Tests

These tests currently depend on `yash` shell and can be run like:

```yash ./run-test.sh /usr/bin/yash while.tst```

Replace `/usr/bin/yash` with the shell that you want to test.

These tests are based on yash shell's POSIX test suite written by [Watanabe Yuki](mailto:magicant@wonderwand.net).
